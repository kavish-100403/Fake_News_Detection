<h1>Fake News Detection</h1>
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fake news articles by analyzing their content. The model is trained on two datasets: one containing real news articles and another containing fake news articles. The classification task involves identifying whether a given article is real or fake based on its text data.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can distinguish between fake and real news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The key steps in this project include:

<ul>
<li>Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
<li>Feature extraction using bag-of-words or TF-IDF</li>
<li>Model training using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and others</li>
<li>Model evaluation using classification metrics like accuracy and precision</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python: Main programming language</li>
<li>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis</li>
<li>NumPy: For numerical operations</li>
<li>Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation</li>
<li>Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization</li>
<li>NLP techniques: Including text preprocessing with regular expressions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
Two datasets were used for this project:

<ul>
  <li>Fake News Dataset: Contains articles labeled as fake news.</li>
<li>Real News Dataset: Contains articles labeled as true news.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the datasets from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kR86sWdjGvY45gwy9uQ8nRXxpOLgSAat?usp=sharing">Google Drive link</a>.</p>


<h3>Model Implementation</h3>
The notebook performs the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Data Loading: Loads the fake and real news datasets.</li>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Cleans the data by removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and stop words.</li>
<li>Feature Extraction: Converts the text data into numerical form using TF-IDF or bag-of-words.</li>
<li>Model Training: Trains different classifiers (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) on the preprocessed data.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
</ol>
